				<h2>The problem we were given</h2>
				<p>
					We were given this incredibly cool problem that involved a few really cool <i>TLAs</i> <b>(Three Letter Acronyms)</b>. Not only were there TLAs, but also some a couple of cool buzz words like Hadoop and <del>3</del>17 V's! And a cat.<img src="assets/img/Grumpy_cat_drawing.jpg" height="150px">

				<h2>We did some cool things!</h2>
				<p>
					We had a look at some of the really amazing things that were out there and created a solution for Some Amazing Company.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem could be broken down into three main areas
					<ol>
						<li> An interesting area </li>
						<li> A fun area </li>
						<li> A difficult area </li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					These areas were specifically targeted by an integrated approach over this Well-Known Technology, this Not-So-Well-Known Technology and our <a href="/solutions/custom">Custom Solution</a> that only we can do.
